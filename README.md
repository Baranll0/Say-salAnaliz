<h2>What is Taylor Series?</h3>
<p>In mathematics, the Taylor series is the representation/expansion of a function as an infinite sum of the terms of that function calculated from the derivative values at a single point.

<h3>What did I do in this app?</h3>
<p>We want to find the value of the cos 𝑥 function at the point 𝜋/5 by calculating the Taylor series. And then we compare it with its real value.</p>

<h4>Algorithmic explanation:</h4>
<p>
-We get the step count information from the user.<br>
-We define the value of x.(𝜋/5 for this application)<br>
-We take the derivative of cosx in the loop and substitute it in the taylor series formula.<br>
-Then we calculate cos(𝜋/5) to find the true result.<br>
-For cutting error (Actual Value - approximate value calculated by Taylor Series)<br>
